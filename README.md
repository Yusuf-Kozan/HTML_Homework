# **Yusuf Kozan's HTML Homework**

I am studying software engineering at Kocaeli University and this program is a homework for the web technologies class.

* I wrote a very short paragraph about myself and added my contact information on the page.
* I used a monochromatic colour scheme, #0069ff being the main colour.
* I designed the layout to look like the information is on cards with rounded corners.
